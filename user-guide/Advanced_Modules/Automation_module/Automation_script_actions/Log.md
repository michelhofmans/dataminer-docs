# Log

Use this action to have a script create a log message that will be saved in the SLAutomation.txt log file. It can either be a pre-determined message, or a message depending on a variable:

- To have a fixed message logged, click the default *Variable* field to select *Message* instead, and type a message in the next field.

- To have a message logged based on a variable, keep *Variable* selected and then click the next field to select the variable.

> [!NOTE]
> - In Cube, any log information regarding Automation can be found under DataMiner logging. For more information, see [DataMiner logging](xref:DataMiner_logging).
> - It is also possible to add this action within a C# block in a script. For more information, see [Log](xref:Skyline.DataMiner.Automation.Engine#Skyline_DataMiner_Automation_Engine_Log_System_String_).
