# Set element state

Use this action to set the state of a dummy in an Automation script:

1. Click *Restart* to select the element state: *Start*, *Stop*, *Restart*, *Pause*, *Mask*, or *Unmask*.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Up to DataMiner version 9.0, when you mask an element, you must also enter a comment. From version 9.0 onwards, it is possible to leave the comment empty.

1. Click the last underlined field to either add an existing dummy element or create a new dummy element.

   > [!NOTE]
   > For more information on creating dummy elements, see [Creating a dummy](xref:Script_variables#creating-a-dummy).
