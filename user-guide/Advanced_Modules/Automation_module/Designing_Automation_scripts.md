# Designing Automation scripts

In the *Automation* module, select a script in the tree view pane on the left in order to configure it in the details pane on the right.

> [!NOTE]
> For more information on how to add a script, see [Adding a new Automation script](xref:Managing_Automation_scripts#adding-a-new-automation-script).

To design a script, you need to specify the general configuration, add script actions, and specify variables when necessary:

- [General script configuration](xref:General_script_configuration)

- [Script variables](xref:Script_variables)

- [Script actions](xref:Script_actions)

As soon as there are unsaved changes in a script, “*\[modified\]*” is added to the script name in the tree view pane, as a reminder in case you navigate to a different script. However, note that if you close the Automation module, such changes will not be saved. To make sure changes to a script are saved, click the *Save script* button. While the script is saving, you will temporarily not be able to make any other changes.

> [!NOTE]
> If a script contains errors, a warning message will be displayed in red at the bottom of the editor pane, and the *Save script* button will be temporarily disabled.
