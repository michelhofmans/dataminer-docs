# Controlling remote access with the Admin app

If you have the Owner or Admin role on dataminer.services, you can enable or disable the [remote access](xref:Cloud_Remote_Access) feature.

1. In the Admin app, check whether the correct organization is mentioned in the header bar.

1. If a different organization should be selected, click the organization selector ![Organization selector](~/user-guide/images/Cloud_Admin_Selector_icon.png) in the top-right corner and select the organization in the list.

1. In the pane on the left, under *DataMiner Systems*, select your DataMiner System and select the *Overview* page.

1. Click the *Edit* button at the top of the page.

1. Set the *Remote Access* setting to *On* or *Off*, depending on whether you want this to be enabled or not.

> [!NOTE]
> Users will only be able to use the remote access feature if they have been given access to the DMS on dataminer.services. See [Controlling user access to dataminer.services features](xref:Giving_users_access_to_cloud_features). They also need to have the [General > DataMiner web apps](xref:DataMiner_user_permissions#general--dataminer-web-apps--dataminer-cube-mobile-access) user permission, as well as any other user permissions required to access specific apps.
