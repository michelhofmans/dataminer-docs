# About the Catalog module

As part of dataminer.services, the Catalog module currently allows Skyline customers and DataMiner Strategic Partners to browse the list of available DataMiner connectors.

In the future, this list will be expanded to also include Automation scripts, dashboards, visual overviews (i.e. ready-made Microsoft Visio files), etc., which you will be able to automatically deploy on your DataMiner System via dataminer.services.
