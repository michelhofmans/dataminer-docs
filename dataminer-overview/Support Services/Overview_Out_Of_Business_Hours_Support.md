# Out-of-business-hours support

Last-minute and planned work may require interventions outside of business hours. When subscribing to Support Services, users have the option to extend the service to out-of-business-hours support or to request this service ad hoc for such interventions.

**Last-minute work** means *level 1 priority* issues with a direct *impact on the system*. The corrective work done for these issues focuses on minimizing their impact on the software and on the system.

**Planned Interventions** refers to planned work, reserved 10 days ahead of the intervention.

> [!NOTE]
> Out-of-business-hours support is available for level 1 priority issues and planned intervention work. For more information, see [Support services terms](xref:Support_services_terms).

## Out-of-business-hours subscription (OBH subscription)

When a user subscribes to this service, Skyline sets up remote access and produces a detailed document describing the system implemented to equip the team working outside of business hours with the necessary information to best assist the user in case of planned or last-minute interventions.

The user then gets access to a **dedicated 24/7 hotline** and can get support over the phone 24 hours per day, 7 days a week.

- **Guaranteed service** for last-minute interventions.
- Reduced [service fee](https://community.dataminer.services/service-credits/) for planned interventions.

## Ad hoc out-of-business-hours services

There is no additional subscription cost, but service fees are charged for the on-demand use of these services.

Planned interventions are available without an active out-of-business-hours subscription. However, for Last-minute interventions, it is not possible to guarantee the response or corrective time.

> [!WARNING]
> Without an active OBH subscription, outside-of-business-hours support for last-minute interventions is provided best-effort; we will do our best to assist you, but we cannot guarantee a timely or satisfactory resolution. This is because our support team does not have remote access to the system and may not have the necessary knowledge about your specific implementation to fix the issue, since the detailed handover documentation is not prepared without a subscription. We recommend an OBH subscription for critical operational systems, to enjoy full support coverage and avoid any potential disruptions or delays.
