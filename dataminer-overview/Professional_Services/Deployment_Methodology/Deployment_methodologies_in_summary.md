# Deployment methodologies in summary

Skyline offers three distinct deployment models for its DataMiner technology, each with its own distinct set of terms and conditions, both commercially and from a practical or process point of view.

The table below summarizes the three methodologies and how the nature of the project at hand defines the type of methodology that needs to be applied to be successful and effective:

| Methodology            | PROJECT CHARACTERISTICS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| TURNKEY                | Clearly defined and very exact project scope and user requirements.<br>Low level of uncertainty and ambiguity regarding user expectations.<br> Low risk for changes, both from a requirement and technical implementation perspective.<br> <br> Offered at fixed price and with mutually agreed deployment time frame.<br> The project is typically offered in two commercial stages, i.e. consultancy & implementation.<br> The implementation uses a typical waterfall methodology managed by a Project Manager.<br> Any changes during implementation are governed by a formal Change Request procedure.<br> <br> Typical examples: basic monitoring-only projects, classic applications like management of an earth station, monitoring of a DTH network, etc.                                      |
| AGILE SCOPE-BASED      | High-level requirements and scope-/goal-oriented. <br>Uncertainty about exact expectations and considerable unknowns.<br>Changes throughout the execution are expected, both because of changed user requirements and expectations, as well as to deal with unknowns that emerge during the technical implementation.<br> <br> Offered at fixed price and with agreed time frame based on the high-level requirements and scope. <br> Scope is agile but will be balanced in terms of time expenditure (i.e. budget & timing are defined).<br> Time budget is fixed and is continuously managed by the Project Squad throughout execution.<br> <br> Typical examples: SRM orchestration projects, automation projects, complex integration projects, complex MoM and end-to-end OSS/BSS solutions, etc. |
| AGILE TIME & MATERIALS | Scope is undefined or not required to start execution.<br> Maximum agility as compared to Agile Scope-Based, as budget is not necessarily a limiting factor.<br> Primary objective is to achieve maximum value delivery.<br> <br> Delivery of expertise at hourly rate.<br> Time expenditure, goals and priorities are fully managed by the user.<br> The Project Squad chooses the exact methodology depending on project specifics (Scrum, Kanban, etc.).<br> Clear agreement is required on expected mid- and long-term availability of Skyline resources.<br> <br> Typical examples: SRM orchestration projects, automation projects, complex integration projects, complex MoM and end-to-end OSS/BSS solutions, etc.                                                                              |

| Clear and very specific requirements, no room for interpretation | High-level requirements, well-defined goals and objectives                                            | Goal- and objective-driven            |
| Process- and tool-oriented                                       | Focus on individuals and interactions with constraints on available time                              | Focus on individuals and interactions |
| Comprehensive documentation and specifications                   | Continuously evolving high-level documentation and maximum focus on working software                  | Delivering working solutions early on |
| Contract- and specification-driven                               | Collaboration-driven towards an agreed well-defined goal within a set time frame                      | Collaboration-driven                  |
| Executing the plan                                               | Working towards the goal, with flexibility to easily respond to change, with time constraints in mind | Responding to change                  |
