## Changes

### Enhancements

#### Navigation on EPM Visual Overview pages improved to stay on those pages \[ID_30700\]

Navigation on EPM Visual Overview pages has improved so that the user stays within the Visual Overview environment as much as possible when clicking buttons or shapes.

### Fixes

#### Core IP filter not working in CM Visual Overview \[ID_30698\]

On the CM Collector Visual Overview pages, it could occur that the Core IP filter did not work.

#### Missing Dashboards icon for RPD-RPA link in RPD topology \[ID_30699\]

In the RPD topology, for each connection link between topology levels, more information can be displayed about the involved interfaces. However, for the connection between RPD and RPA, this information window did not show the Dashboards icon that can be used to navigate to the Dashboards app.

#### Incorrect automatic removal of collectors \[ID_30773\]

In some cases, it could occur that collectors were automatically removed from the EPM Collector tables even though these were not supposed to be removed yet.
