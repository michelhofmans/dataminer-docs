## Features

### Teams Bot: Group conversations

The DataMiner Teams Bot now supports group conversations. This means that you can now install the bot in a Teams channel or group and use any of the existing commands.

### Teams Bot: 'Show Views' command

A new *Show Views* command is now available in the Teams Bot. This command will show the visual overview of the specified view.

For now, it is not yet possible to see all pages of the visual overview, but this functionality will be added in a future version, along with additional alarm information.
