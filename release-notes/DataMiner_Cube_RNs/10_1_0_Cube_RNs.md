## Changes in DataMiner 10.1.0 CU18

### Enhancements

#### Alarm Console: Time of history sets will now always be converted to the local time zone [ID_33849]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU18]/10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

From now on, the time of history sets will always be converted to the local time zone.

### Fixes

#### Trending: Creation, update and deletion of a trend pattern would not be communicated to the other DataMiner Agents in the DMS [ID_33624]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU18]/10.2.0 [CU5] - Feature Release Version 10.2.8 -->

When you created, updated or deleted a tag, up to now, this would incorrectly not be communicated to the other DataMiner Agents in the DMS.

#### SLAnalytics - Pattern matching: No 'suggestion event' type alarm would be triggered in case of DVE elements [ID_32671]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU18]/10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.5 -->

From DataMiner 10.0.13 onwards, you can activate alarm monitoring of trend patterns, so that a "suggestion event" type alarm is triggered whenever a specific pattern is detected. In case of dynamic virtual elements, in some cases, no "suggestion event" type alarm would be triggered.

#### System Center: Element counter on Agents > Status tab would not be set to 0 when removing all elements from a DMA [ID_33885]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU18]/10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

When you go to *System Center > Agents > Status*, the *Elements* column shows you how many elements are being hosted by each agent in the DMS.

When, on a particular agent, you removed all elements, the number of elements of that agent would incorrectly not be set to 0. Instead, it would be set to the last-known number of elements on that agent before the element were removed.
