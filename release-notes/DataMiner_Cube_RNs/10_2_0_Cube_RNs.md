## Changes in DataMiner 10.2.0 CU6

### Enhancements

### Fixes

#### SLAnalytics - Pattern matching: No “suggestion event” type alarm would be triggered in case of DVE elements [ID_32671]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU18]/10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.5 -->

From DataMiner 10.0.13 onwards, you can activate alarm monitoring of trend patterns, so that a "suggestion event" type alarm is triggered whenever a specific pattern is detected. In case of dynamic virtual elements, in some cases, no "suggestion event" type alarm would be triggered.
