## Changes in DataMiner 10.2.0 CU6

### Enhancements

#### Alarm Console: Time of history sets will now always be converted to the local time zone [ID_33849]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU18]/10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

From now on, the time of history sets will always be converted to the local time zone.

#### Alarm Console - Proactive cap detection: Reduction of false positive matches [ID_33871]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

When trend data is often getting close to the low or high value of a data range, this data range value will no longer be considered as a critical data boundary. This will reduce the number of false positive matches.

### Fixes

#### SLAnalytics - Pattern matching: No 'suggestion event' type alarm would be triggered in case of DVE elements [ID_32671]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU18]/10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.5 -->

From DataMiner 10.0.13 onwards, you can activate alarm monitoring of trend patterns, so that a "suggestion event" type alarm is triggered whenever a specific pattern is detected. In case of dynamic virtual elements, in some cases, no "suggestion event" type alarm would be triggered.

#### Alarm Console would incorrectly keep loading while the tickets linked to the alarms were being loaded [ID_33847]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU18]/10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

When you open DataMiner Cube, it will load the alarms and try to link the existing tickets to them so it can show the ticket information in the Alarm Console.

While this process was ongoing, in some rare cases, the Alarm Console would incorrectly keep on loading. 

#### System Center: Element counter on Agents > Status tab would not be set to 0 when removing all elements from a DMA [ID_33885]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU18]/10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

When you go to *System Center > Agents > Status*, the *Elements* column shows you how many elements are being hosted by each agent in the DMS.

When, on a particular agent, you removed all elements, the number of elements of that agent would incorrectly not be set to 0. Instead, it would be set to the last-known number of elements on that agent before the element were removed.

#### Spectrum analysis: Recording icon would no longer be displayed while making a spectrum recording [ID_33904]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

While making a spectrum recording, in some cases, the recording icon would no longer be displayed.

#### Visual Overview: Wait cursor would still be displayed after the scripts had already finished [ID_33911]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

When, in Visual Overview, you clicked a shape that executed two Automation scripts, the cursor would incorrectly still be displayed as a wait cursor after the two scripts had already finished.
