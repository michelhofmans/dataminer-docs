# CLI (legacy packages only)

It is possible to start a legacy application using its CLI, with the following arguments:

- The full path to the profile used to compose the package

- The full path to the location where the package needs to be saved

For example:

```txt
DataMinerApplicationPackageBuilder.exe "C:\Profiles\Profile1.xml" "C:\Build\Test.dmapp"
```
