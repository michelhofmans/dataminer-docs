# DMT tab

The *DMT* tab allows you to create DataMiner test packages (\*.dmt) to be used with the Skyline Driver Passport Platform Manager.

The following settings can be configured here:

- *Number of Packages*: Defines the number of test packages to be included.

- *Element scaling increment*: Defines how many instances per original element should incrementally run with every iteration. For example, in case there are 2 elements in the DMAPP package, *setting Number of Packages*Â to 3 and *Element scaling increment* to 4 will include the following packets in the DMT:

    - Packet 1 = containing 2 elements (= original elements in DMAPP, typically each using a different protocol)

    - Packet 2 = containing 8 elements = 2 \* scaling increment (4) \* increment step (1)

    - Packet 3 = containing 16 elements = 2 \* scaling increment (4) \* increment step (2)

- *Interval*: Specifies the time between the different test iterations.

- *Duration*: Specifies the running time of a test iteration.

For each element, the element connections and simulation files to be used can be configured:

- *Simulation data*: Allows you to select a simulation (XML) file that will be used by the simulator.

- *Database Simulation data*: Allows you to select the TXT file generated by the SNMP proxy simulator containing realistic data.
