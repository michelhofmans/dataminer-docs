# DataMiner Application Package Builder

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This section might include some information that is only applicable to Skyline employees and/or links that are only accessible to Skyline employees.

The DataMiner Application Package Builder can be used to create DataMiner application (legacy) packages (\*.dmapp) and DataMiner test packages (\*.dmt).

- **DataMiner application packages** are used to deploy applications and solutions on a DataMiner Platform. From DataMiner 10.0.11 onwards, a new format and features have been introduced for these packages.

    For more information on the structure of a package from DataMiner 10.0.11 onwards, see [Application packages](xref:TOOApplicationPackages).
    For an overview of the internal structure of a legacy application package, see [Contents of an upgrade package](xref:Contents_of_an_upgrade_package).

- **DataMiner test packages** are used to run scaling performance tests on the Skyline Driver Passport Platform.

    A DataMiner test package consists of multiple .dmapp packages, a configuration file and optional accompanying simulation files. The content of the different .dmapp packages is the same, but with an increasing number of elements.
