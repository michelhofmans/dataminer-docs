# Logging

During the creation of a DMAPP, logging is added to a *BuildLogging.txt* file, indicating:

- Which profile was used, or which "Manual Mapping" in case no profile was applied.

- Which files were loaded correctly to be included in the package.

- Which files were not loaded correctly to be included in the package.

- Validation against the profile used for package creation.<br>In case any files that were expected by the profile were not included in the package, these will be summed up here.
