# Platform capabilities

Simulations of the following protocol types are currently supported by the platform and device simulator:

- SNMP

- HTTP (POST and GET only)

The platform is only able to run up to 50 simulations. A scaling packet can therefore contain at most 50 elements using 1 connection or 25 elements using 2 connections.

Simulations should be taken using "Realistic Dynamic Simulations".
